**<mark>Introduction:</mark>** In the world of software development, there's a need to package and deploy applications consistently and reliably. Docker is a popular tool that makes this process easier and more efficient. In this article, we'll explore Docker and understand how it works using simple language.

**<mark>What is Docker?</mark>** Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. These containers package the application code along with its dependencies, libraries, and other required components. It ensures that the application runs smoothly on any machine, regardless of its environment.

**<mark>How does Docker work?</mark>**

1. **<mark>Containers:</mark>** Think of a container as a lightweight and isolated virtual machine (VM). Unlike a traditional VM, which requires a separate operating system, a Docker container shares the host system's OS. Containers are isolated from one another, making them secure and independent.
    
2. **<mark>Docker Image:</mark>** The foundation of Docker is an image. An image is a read-only template that contains the application code, runtime, libraries, tools, and settings required to run the application. It's like a snapshot of a container's filesystem at a specific point in time.
    
3. **<mark>Dockerfile:</mark>** To create an image, you use a text file called a Dockerfile. It defines the steps to build the image and specifies the dependencies and configurations needed. A Dockerfile can be compared to a recipe that guides Docker on how to assemble the image.
    
4. **<mark>Building an Image:</mark>** Once you have a Dockerfile, you can build an image using the Docker CLI (Command-Line Interface). The CLI reads the Dockerfile and executes the instructions inside it, fetching the necessary components and creating the image.
    
5. **<mark>Docker Registry:</mark>** Docker images can be stored in a centralized location called a registry. Docker Hub is a popular public registry, but you can also set up your private registry. Images in the registry can be shared, pulled, and reused by others.
    
6. **<mark>Running Containers:</mark>** To run an application, you create a container from an image. You can run multiple containers from the same image, each with its isolated environment. The container runs in an isolated process, making it independent of other containers.
    
7. **<mark>Container Orchestration:</mark>** When working with a large number of containers, Docker provides tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes for container orchestration. These tools help manage and scale containers across multiple machines, ensuring high availability and reliability.
    

**<mark>Advantages of Docker:</mark>**

* **<mark>Portability:</mark>** Docker containers are platform-independent and can run on any machine with Docker installed, eliminating compatibility issues.
    
* **<mark>Efficiency:</mark>** Containers are lightweight and share the host system's resources, allowing efficient resource utilization and faster startup times.
    
* **<mark>Isolation:</mark>** Containers provide a secure and isolated environment, preventing one application from affecting others.
    
* **<mark>Scalability:</mark>** Docker's container orchestration tools enable easy scaling of applications, allowing them to handle increased traffic and demand.
    

**<mark>Conclusion:</mark>** Docker simplifies the process of packaging and deploying applications by encapsulating them in portable and lightweight containers. With Docker, developers can focus on building applications without worrying about differences in environments. Its ease of use, portability, and scalability make it a valuable tool in modern software development.

### **<mark>Why Do We Use Docker?</mark>**

**Simplifying Software Installation Across Platforms**

**<mark>Introduction:</mark>** Docker is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of installing and managing software across different platforms. Whether you're using Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows, Docker provides a consistent and streamlined approach to software installation. In this article, we'll explore why Docker is so widely used and how it makes installing applications like MySQL on various platforms much easier.

1. **<mark>Eliminating Platform Dependencies:</mark>** One of the main challenges in software installation is dealing with platform dependencies. Different operating systems have their requirenments, configurations, and package managers. Docker addresses this issue by encapsulating applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers. These containers can be run on any machine that has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system. This means you can install and run applications like MySQL using Docker with the same ease and consistency across Ubuntu, macOS, or Windows.
    
2. **<mark>Reproducible Environments:</mark>** Another advantage of using Docker is the ability to create reproducible environments. With traditional installations, it can be challenging to ensure that all the required dependencies are installed correctly and in the right versions. Docker allows you to define the exact environment and dependencies needed for an application using a Dockerfile. This file contains all the instructions to build an image, including the base operating system, libraries, and configuration files. By sharing the Dockerfile, you can ensure that others can replicate the same environment and easily set up the application without any guesswork or compatibility issues.
    
3. **<mark>Simplified Installation Steps:</mark>** Installing complex software like MySQL often involves multiple steps, including downloading the installer, configuring settings, and resolving dependencies. With Docker, these steps are simplified and consolidated. By leveraging pre-built Docker images from trusted sources or creating your own, you can skip the tedious installation process and have a fully functional application up and running in minutes. Docker images are portable and self-contained, encapsulating everything needed to run the application, including the software itself and its dependencies.
    
4. **<mark>Isolation and Security:</mark>** Docker provides an isolated and secure environment for running applications. Each container runs as an isolated process, ensuring that the application and its dependencies do not interfere with the host system or other containers. This isolation enhances security by minimizing the potential impact of any vulnerabilities in the application or its dependencies. Additionally, Docker allows you to define fine-grained access controls, network configurations, and resource limits for each container, further enhancing the overall security of the system.
    

**<mark>Conclusion:</mark>** Docker simplifies software installation across different platforms by eliminating platform dependencies, providing reproducible environments, and streamlining installation steps. With Docker, installing complex applications like MySQL becomes a breeze, allowing developers and system administrators to focus on their core tasks rather than wrestling with intricate installation processes. Embracing Docker not only saves time and effort but also ensures consistent and reliable application deployment in any environment.

### Starting some Hands-On Projects

1. **<mark>Lets start by adding NGNIX with docker in your terminal:-</mark>**
    
    NGINX is a lightweight and high-performance web server and reverse proxy server. It excels in handling high-traffic loads efficiently and is commonly used for serving static files, load balancing, caching, content delivery, and enhancing security. NGINX's event-driven architecture ensures optimal resource utilization and fast response times, making it a popular choice in modern web architectures.
    

<mark>i) To Add NGINX there is a command </mark> `sudo docker pull ngnix`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686644517639/7f0f78cd-eb5a-4e05-aace-e9462cfdcbdf.png align="center")

<mark>ii) After that to run the nginx with docker the command is </mark> `docker run -d nginx:latest`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686644773567/e715761b-716c-4a63-9f28-ab009a50e79c.png align="center")

<mark>iii) Now bind the ports of host and the nginx</mark>

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686645041222/5d5cbaff-758b-45b6-bef4-a2d348bd94de.png align="center")

<mark>iv) Now go to your AWS instance server copy the public ip from it...</mark>

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686645300945/bdd25a70-2b07-429b-8a29-948ad6113013.png align="center")

<mark>v) Now paste it into the browser and press enter then you can see that the NGINX is Successfully running.</mark>

### **<mark>Main Project:-</mark>**

**<mark>Title: Running a Django App with Docker: Simplified Deployment and Scalability</mark>**

**<mark>Introduction:</mark>** In this project, we will explore how to use Docker to run a Django application, simplifying the deployment process and enabling scalability. Docker allows you to package your Django app, its dependencies, and its configuration into a container, ensuring consistent execution across different environments. Let's dive into the steps required to set up and run your Django app using Docker.

1. Make the Directory in your local terminal for the Projects to make it easier, after making it go to that directory and then clone the app from the git with the help of `git clone` command.
    
    To clone the app you need to know the address of the git repo in which the application is stored.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686646216501/1d035a26-73e2-4f2e-a8c3-0417cf70bb1b.png align="center")
    
    After copying the link paste it in the directory which you made for the projects with the `git clone` command.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686646293242/fd76040f-eec5-478e-b937-ebac00e21abf.png align="center")
    
2. Now we have to go further in the search for Dockerfile, if the Dockerfile is present then we don't need to make it again, and if it is not present then we have to work on it, now let's see what we got.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686647080011/dc9f88bc-9351-4f46-8f92-fd6cf99af89e.png align="center")
    

As you see if we got the Dockerfile here then we don't have to make it further, then we just have to make the docker image.

By running the command `sudo docker build . -t` where. stands for "here" and "-t" stands for token.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686647447639/fa1d407d-9d59-4c08-9f49-17a8130c0d0c.png align="center")

1. Now we have to make a docker container from the docker Image and for that, there is a command `sudo docker -d -p 8000:8000 <app_name>:token`
    
    Here 8000:8000 stands for the port of the host and the server...
    
2. Now to run the App in real-time we have to edit the inbound rules of the AWS EC2 instance and make open the 8000 port from there
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686648801692/d394fe75-9039-48df-969b-9c67d0f2ad78.png align="center")
