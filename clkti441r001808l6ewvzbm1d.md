**Step 8: Install Serverless CLI**

Before Installing serverless CLI it is mandatory to install Node.js and npm.

To install Node.js and npm from scratch on Ubuntu, you can use the NodeSource repository, which provides up-to-date and officially supported packages. Here are the commands to install Node.js and npm on Ubuntu:

1. First, update the package index and install some prerequisites:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install curl
    ```
    
2. Install Node.js using the NodeSource setup script (choose one of the supported versions mentioned in the output you provided, e.g., Node.js 16 "Gallium" or Node.js 18 LTS "Hydrogen" - it's recommended to use a supported version):
    
    ```bash
    # For Node.js 16 "Gallium" (Recommended)
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
    
    # For Node.js 18 LTS "Hydrogen" (Recommended)
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -
    
    # Note: If you want a different version, replace "16" or "18" with the desired version number.
    ```
    
3. After running the setup script, install Node.js and npm:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    ```
    
4. Confirm the installation by checking the Node.js and npm versions:
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
    

> That's it! You should now have Node.js and npm installed on your Ubuntu system.
> 
> Remember that using the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js is recommended for most use cases, as it provides stability and security updates for an extended period. If you want to install a different version, you can check the NodeSource repository mentioned in the output you provided for more details on the available versions.

* With your account set up, it's time to install the Serverless CLI on your local machine. Follow the installation instructions provided on the Serverless Framework website.
    
    ## Onboard using the Serverless Framework
    
    If you are a Serverless Framework user, you can onboard to Serverless Console from the CLI.
    
    Upgrade to version 3.24.0+
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g serverless
    #Run this command to add the AWS Account integration.
    
    serverless --console 
    #You'll need to deploy the function if you haven't already.
    
    serverless deploy
    #Next, you'll need to instrument the newly deployed function from the browser.
    ```
    

Next, you'll need to instrument the newly deployed function from the browser.
